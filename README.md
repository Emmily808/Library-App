# Library-App [view live](https://emmily808.github.io/Library-App/)

The Library App is a web application that allows you to manage and keep track of a book collection. You can add books, specify the author, and mark them as read or unread. 

This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, focusing on building a library using Object Constructors and LocalStorage.

## Features

- Add books to your library by providing the book title, author, and read status (read or unread).
- Display books in a table format for easy viewing and management.
- Delete books from your library.
- Toggle the read status of books to mark them as read or unread.

## Objects Constructor:
- In this project the main goal was to use Object Constructors to handle the storing each book. I was learn how to create an Object Constructor, store each one on an array and then loop throught the array to display the books.

## LocalStorage:
- To handle the storage of the books, i learned the basics about LocalStorage, using methods like setItem(), getItem(), JSON stringify and parse methods.
